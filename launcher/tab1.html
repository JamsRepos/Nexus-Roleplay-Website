<strong>TokoVOIP Hotfixes</strong>
<p>We noticed a few people, who are potenially newer to FiveM have had certain issues with getting their microphone and or PTT bind to work with TokoVOIP, please see below some community found answers that will hopefully fix your problems.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>- Navigate to <b>[Tools > Options > Capture]</b> and ensure that your capture device is set to your main input device. Sometimes having it simply to set to "Default" will not work.</li>
  <li>- Ensure that, in the same menu as above, your Teamspeak is set to "Push to Talk" and the correct key is enabled.</li>
  <li>- If your in-game voice is still not being activated by your desired key, ensure you are using the correct Hotkey Profile, by navigating to <b>[Self > Hotkey Profile]</b></li>
  <li>- Please note, your in-game radio keybind can be set by opening your FiveM keybind settings, and navigating to <b>[Cars/Bikes/Boats > Bicycle Sprint]</b> and changing that bind to your desired radio PTT bind.</li>
</ul>
